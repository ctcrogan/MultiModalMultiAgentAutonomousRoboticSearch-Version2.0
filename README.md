We present a heterogeneous multi-agent system that uses an autonomous aerial 
drone as a remote sensor for a ground search operation. A quadcopter equipped
with a ground-facing camera scouts a designated area semi-autonomously, 
searching for a set of target objects. When a target is spotted, a ground 
vehicle is dispatched to its location. The emphasis of this prototype is 
on an architectural design that will maximize fault tolerance, generalization,
and scalability of the system.

A special thanks to Nathan Ledoux for laying the foundation for this project.
